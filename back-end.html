    <P style="background-color:#d6e6f2";>Back-end developers primarily develop and maintain the core functional logic and operations of a software application or information system.
      Typically, a back-end developer has expert programming skills in C++, C#, Java and other high-level programming languages.
      The key job role of a back-end developer is to ensure that the data or services requested by the front-end system or software are delivered through programmatic means.
      Back-end developers also create and maintain the entire back-end of a system, which consists of the core application logic, databases, data and application integration,
      API and other back-end processes. Moreover, a back-end developer performs the testing and debugging of any back-end application or system.
